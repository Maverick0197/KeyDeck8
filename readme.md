# KeyDeck8


The KeyDeck8 is a small, direct wired, macro pad with 8 keys and 1 encoder powered by a ProMicro.

It runs on QMK and is VIA compatible.

The board was originally designed by obscuresausage ([link to his files](https://www.printables.com/model/389352-multimedia-key-deck)) and the firmware was written by myself.

# Firmware

This keyboard uses [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/).

If you flash the VIA firmware then the board can be programmed with [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/).

I have included a keyboard.JSON file for uploading into the Design tab on VIA.

You can find everything you need to build a firmware for this board in the [KeyDeck8 QMK Repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/maverick0197/keydeck8).

I have included pre-compiled hex files for flashing the KeyDeck8 in the Default and VIA folders.
